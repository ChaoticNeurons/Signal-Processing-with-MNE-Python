# Signal-Processing with MNE-Python
I'll be sharing my codes here for the analysis of human neurophysiological data. Open for discussions.
This code repository is for codes written in python-MNE for the signal processing of E/MEG data. The codes are written and remodified for the group analysis of resting-state E/MEG data. You may refer to the original codes at MNE-Python website.
For any code related query or discussion, you can contact at vivek.sharma1510@gmail.com.
